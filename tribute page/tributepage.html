            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#X2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised
                in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's
                earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat
                in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential 
                leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, 
                organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#X2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime
                Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to 
                Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. Besides those provinces that had 
                been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been 
                released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. 
                Patel, together with Nehru and Menon persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#X2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patel's commitment to national integration in 
                the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".
                He is also remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for playing a pioneering
                role in establishing the modern All India Services system. 
                The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government 
                at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 
                182 metres (597 ft) in height.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#X2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1946 Indian provincial elections, the Congress won a large majority
                of the elected seats, dominating the Hindu electorate. How
                ever the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah won a large majority of Muslim electora
                te seats. The League had resolved in 1940 to demand Pakistan an independent state for Muslims
                and was a fierce critic of the Congress. The Congress formed governments in all provinces 
                save Sindh, Punjab, and Bengal, where it entered into coalitions with other parties.
